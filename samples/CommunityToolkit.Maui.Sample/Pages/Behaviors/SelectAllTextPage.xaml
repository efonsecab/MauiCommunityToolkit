                            Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?

Just my luck, no ice. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.
